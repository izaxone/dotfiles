# Dotfiles
This repository is my current dotfile configuration for apps like [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

# Installation
Clone the repository to a directory in the root of your home folder (i.e. `~/.dotfiles`). 

Then run the script `mklnk.sh`. 

You will also have to install [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) as a plugin manager.
